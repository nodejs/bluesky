The future of OSUOSL is in jeopardy - as a nonprofit, they provide build and test infra for many OSS projects for free, nurturing smaller projects and filling out support matrices for bigger projects like Node.js. Please help them keep the lights on for the OSS world! https://osuosl.org/blog/osl-future/

Node.js currently relies on OSUOSL to test and/or release binaries for Linux arm64, Linux ppc64le, and AIX. To learn more about why they are important for other OSS projects like us and how you can donate, check out https://osuosl.org/donate/
